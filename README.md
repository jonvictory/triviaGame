# triviaGame
This is a trivia game assignment, for the University of Utah coding boot camp. 2019.


This assignment was used to familiarize us with timers. 

The game starts with a start screen. Once the start screen is clicked, the first timer starts.
The timer will countdown until the player selects an answer, or until it runs out of time.
If the player selects the correct answer, the game informs them of their correct selection.
if the player slects an incorrect answer, the game informs them of their incorrect selection.
if the clock runs our of time, the game informs the player of what answer was correct, and automatically loads the next question.
The player can end the game early, via a button in the lower corner. At which point, their score will be calculated.
Otherwise, the game will end automatically when all the questions of cycled. At which point, the player will have the option to reset the game (without resetting the browser.)
